# <a name="nuget-warning-nu3037"></a>NuGet Warning NU3037

### <a name="issue"></a>Sorun

A NuGet package signature has expired.
A package signature shares the same validity period as the certificate used to generate the signature. A package signature is invalid outside of that validity period.
To ensure long-term validity --- even beyond the signing certificate’s validity period --- a package signature should be timestamped with a trusted timestamp. Trusted timestamps must be added while a package signature is still valid and not expired.


### <a name="solution"></a>Çözüm

* Resign the package with a non-expired certificate. Optionally, add a trusted timestamp at the time of signing to ensure long-term validity of the signature.
* For accept mode only, ignore the warning.

> [!Note]
> When NuGet’s [signature validation mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/installing-signed-packages#configure-package-signature-requirements) is set to accept (default), a package with an expired package signature is treated as an unsigned package and installed anyway. NU3037 is raised as a warning. When NuGet’s signature validation mode is set to require, or when running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3037 is elevated from a warning to an error.
