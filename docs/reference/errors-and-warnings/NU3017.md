## <a name="scenario-2"></a>Senaryo 2

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature's certificate is not yet valid.</pre>

### <a name="issue"></a>Sorun

The certificate used to sign the package has a validity in the future, but is not valid currently.


### <a name="solution"></a>Çözüm

Please request the package author to re-sign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/create-packages/sign-a-package) with a signing certificate which is currently valid.


> [!Note]
> When NuGet’s [signature validation mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/installing-signed-packages#configure-package-signature-requirements) is set to accept (default), NU3017 is raised as a warning. When NuGet’s signature validation mode is set to require, or when running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3017 is elevated from a warning to an error.
